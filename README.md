# Trend Viewer

And interactive trend viewer

## Installation

Clone to repo to your machine and then run `npm install`.

Once the installation is complete, run the command `npm run dev` and then navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser. You should now be able to use the trend viewer.

## Tech Stack

The game uses React inside of NextJS for the view. One advantage of using NextJS is that it ships with API Routes, which you can use as a Server and leverage with `apollo-server-micro` to implement a Full-Stack GraphQL API. For more info about that, see my blog series [here](https://medium.com/swlh/server-side-graphql-with-apollo-nextjs-part-1-setup-2615410c4966).
